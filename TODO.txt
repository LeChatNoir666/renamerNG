-= TODO (ideas to possibly implement) =-
* Add new code from Matt
* Button to rename files (optional through setting?)
* Sort by clicking columns
* Sort by moving around items.
* Fix preview of selection? Possible to implement easily?
* Search for updates on the internet
* Settings dialog with save/restore?
* Reduce flicker when moving in list with arrow keys
* Progress display for operations and macros
* Fix settings so that size is restored correctly (even with different DPI settings)
* Support for command line operation?
* Move scanning to separate dialog?
* Work mode auto? Is this mode unclear or too dangerous?
* Change macro list into a listview to make the selected item change when right-clicking.
* Hot keys for operations/macros specified by user.
* Get tagging info from dir name.
* Support all operations from Renamer 6.0
