-= TODO (ideas to possibly implement, in no particular order) =-
* OnScan persistent macro that is executed on scanning.
* List dirs first as in most file managers
* List Columns zip up to a default size when the prefs change - stop this, or resize the columns to fit the widest entry?
* Button to rename files (optional through setting?)
* Sort by clicking columns
* Sort by moving around items.
* Fix preview of selection? Possible to implement easily?
* Search for updates on the internet
* Settings dialog with save/restore?
* Reduce flicker when moving in list with arrow keys
* Add "Execute" operation to support external programs. - maybe we can double click the file entry in the list to run this
* Progress display for operations and macros
* Fix settings so that size is restored correctly (even with different DPI settings)
* Improve command line operation, split Engine from FrmMain.
* Move scanning to separate dialog?
* Work mode auto? Is this mode unclear or too dangerous?
* Change macro list into a listview to make the selected item change when right-clicking.
* Hot keys for operations/macros specified by user.
* Get tagging info from dir name.
* Support all operations from Renamer 6.0
	- Multi change (reg exp enough?)
	- Auto replace?
	- Trim extension
	- Make it a Title
	- Upper Case after find (make the character after a find operation upper case)
	- ABBREVIATIONS (example u.s.a. -> U.S.A)
	- Insert random number
	- Remove read only attribute
	- Truncate (with or without extension?) (trunkating extension (ex 8.3) ?)
	- Force N digit numbers
	- Ingore dirs (useful when having dirs in the list and avoid operations on them)
	- Sort list after file
	- Remove item from list
	- Delete item from disk
	- Export file (for example to create a batch file for renaming or exporting a dir list)
* Support some new operations
	- Lower case after find
	- Insert unique random number or hash of some kind
	- Internet or FreeDbOffline search
	- "Execute" operation to support external programs.
	


-= Working on (if working on an item move it here (when done delete it)) =-
