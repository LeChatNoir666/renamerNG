<h1><a name="regexp">Regular expressions</h1>
One of the most powerful features of RenamerNG is the possibility to execute
regular expressions. If you are new to regular expressions you can have a look
at <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info" target="_blank">http://www.regular-expressions.info</a>
to learn more.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1><a name="cli">Command Line Interface (CLI)</h1>
RenamerNG now as an experimental CLI that enables the user to enter commands
(operations or macros) as text and execute them.<br>
<pre>
Syntax:

operation or macro name[|parameter1][|parameter2][...]
</pre>
The syntax checking is not that advanced and you can easily cause a command to
fail by spelling wrong, but If you like to tinker with it, it's available. If
many users like this feature it will be further developed. To specify a | in
for example a replace operation use \| other escapes are \n for new line and
\" for double quote.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1><a name="args">Parameters during startup</h1>
RenamerNG can be started with three different sets of parameters if
none or one parameter is given RenamerNG will start and scan the dir
if specified.<br>
<pre>
Syntax:

RenamerNG [directory]

directory - Should be a valid directory used for simple shell integration
</pre>
<br>
<br>
<h1><a name="onscan">OnScan macro</h1>
After each time a directory is scanned RenamerNG will look for a macro named
"OnScan" if this macro exists it will be automatically executed. This allows
you to record any operations in this macro that you want to be executed when
you scan a directory.
